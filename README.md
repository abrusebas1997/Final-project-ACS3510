**Data clustering for spotify songs**

My goal for this project is to make predictions about what are the most immportant features you need to have in mind if you want to enter into the music industry on spotify

I found [my dataset of spotify song](https://https://www.kaggle.com/edalrami/19000-spotify-songs?select=song_data.csv)s on Kaggle.com

Here is my project on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kqLeXhuMeEwQgHzktheiDJYdAU9O5CXE#scrollTo=PzK9NmAUKY3Z)
